# Clustering-Similar-Faces-Using-K-means-and-DBSCAN
This GitHub repository contains code and resources for the final project of the "Unsupervised Machine Learning" course, part of the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate. The project aims to cluster similar faces based on their embeddings. It utilizes K-means and DBSCAN algorithms to group embeddings, visualizes the results, and addresses alignment and model limitations for improved accuracy.
